QGDsolver is OpenFOAM framework for simulation of fluid flows using regularized equations approach. It contains library for approximation of partial derivatives at face centers of unstructured grids and a set of OpenFOAM solvers for:

1. QGDFoam - solver for compressible viscous perfect gas flows in a wide Mach number range - from 0 to infinity
2. QHDFoam - solver for incompressible viscous fluid flows with buoyancy force
3. particlesQGDFOam - solver for compressible viscous perfect gas flows in a wide Mach number range with particles - from 0 to infinity
4. particlesQHDFoam - solver for incompressible viscous fluid flows with buoyancy force with particles
5. SRFQHDFoam - solver for incompressible viscous fluid flows in rotating frame of reference  with buoyancy force
6. QHDDyMFoam -  solver for incompressible viscous fluid flows in domains with deforming boundary and with buoyancy force
7. interQHDFoam - solver for incompressible 2-phase viscous fluid flows with buoyancy force and surface tension
8. reactingLagrangianQGDFoam - solver for reacting multicomponent compressible viscous perfect gas flows in a wide Mach number range with particles - from 0 to infinity
9. scalarTransportQHDFoam - solver for scalar transport equation to demonstrate **the very basics** of QGD/QHD equations principles
